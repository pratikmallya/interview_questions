Interview Questions
===================

Preparing for technical interviews is a big pain. However, many interview
questions are fairly nice. Many times, I felt that I wanted to work on a
problem more but was restricted by the 1 hr limit.

This is a repository where I shall collect
such interview questions found all over the web, and attempt to solve
them on my own, using python3.
